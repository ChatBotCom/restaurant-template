# Bot Restaurant Template

**ðŸ†• This template works with the new Visual Builder and the old one ðŸ†•**

To add the product to your order, display current status and start the process again, weâ€™ve prepared a simple backend.

This example was written in Javascript and requires Node.js, but you can rewrite this code to any other server-side language you want. Itâ€™s effortless to use, but if you donâ€™t trust me, check it yourself ðŸ˜€ .
